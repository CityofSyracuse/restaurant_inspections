Be aware that spray painting NSF equipment may void the approval and may cause unsafe/toxic materials flaking into food (no violation observed). No hose observed on mop sink faucet, but if hose is attached to faucet, ensure that proper backflow prevention is installed on unit. Faucet has shut off valve which could put backflow preventer under continuous pressure (may damage backflow preventers rated for noncontinuous pressure). On two different occasions, front hand sink was running at approximately 120-126F no matter which foot pedal was depressed. Left lever would eventually give cooler water after 15-30 seconds of running. Ensure that mixing valve is working properly to prevent scald hazard.

Ensure that soap dispensers are located to not contaminate foods, utensils, etc.  Please note the following guidance given on the inspection of 6/13/12:  ""Per conversation with Jumalon, remove panini grill from prep sink adjacent to hot line and repurpose to chicken prep. Extend splash guard at adjacent handwash sink outward to edge of prep counter.""  This guidance is still in effect and modifications have not been made.  Make modifications as noted.

When non-continuous cooking is used, written procedures must be in place and the process requires prior department approval. Also, the par cooked tenders should be stored/handled as raw chicken.

Areas outside of the gymnasium, modular class buildings, and at the end of the 500 hall have areas of standing water due to poor drainage. These areas require landscaping to allow the runoff rainwater to drain out of these areas. Example: Installation of drainage ditches or drainage diversions. Facility is currently under renovation to remove areas of asbestos, update the fire alarm system, and to install a new air conditioning system in the building. These renovations have chipped, damaged, and scraped areas on the building that were identified as having lead based paint and had undergone lead paint stabilization and remediation. These areas include the interior and exterior class door frames and stair hand rails in the original school building and gym. These areas of damaged lead based paint will require repainting with lead safe work procedures. Specialized cleaning procedures to remove possible areas of lead contaminated dust from the adjacent floors next to the areas of damaged lead based paint is also required as  part of the remediation. Wake County Environmental Services will conduct follow up visits and environmental sampling to verify that the remediation of the lead paint hazards has been completed. Please contact Christy Klaus, the Wake County Environmental Services Lead Program Coordinator, with any questions in regards to the lead paint hazard remediation.

Children should be kept away from these areas until repairs have been completed. If children touch the paint in these areas they should wash their hands immediately. Wake County Environmental Services Lead Program will be performing a follow up visit to verify repair of the non intact paint in these areas. All work to repair the areas of non intact lead based paint should be completed when the children are not present in the classrooms. All other exterior door casings on the 400 hall are also chipped and require repainting as well. Drainage ditches are needed at the pre-k playground to carry runoff to nearby drains.

Incandescent or halogen light bulbs get hot and would be a better choice for a heat lamp. ....Over the cold hold wells and over the top of the prep unit there are lights that get very hot. It would be best to choose lights such as LED or compact fluorescent light bulbs in a location where the food has to stay cold.  Another advantage to LED's is most are plastic and and do not require a shield.,Inspection

The rear building and cafeteria (all buildings with grass or weeds growing around them) have severely damaged skirting because string trimmers are being used to maintain the grounds.

Continued use of string trimmers will eventually cut the bottom of the skirting completely away.",Inspection

NC Food Code requires a minimum temperature of 75F for quat sanitizers. At 53F the solution was registering around 400 ppm and PIC stated that they usually dilute the solution using hot water to bring the temperature up to 75F and lower the concentration to around 200 ppm. As long as the solution is being used at the correct minimum temperature and the concentration meets minimum requirements, methods used by this facility are allowed but it is recommended to have a mixing valve installed so that the solution temperature is regulated at 75-110F and hot water does not have to be added manually to dilute the sanitizing solutions.<br>At the automatic handsink next to the dish area, the water temperature cannot be manually adjusted and was reaching 130F. This temperature can cause scalding and does not allow for proper handwashing. The water temperature needs to be adjusted so that it is at least 100F but does not exceed 120F. Ideal handwashing temperature is 110-115F.",Inspection

The sink can be used for handwashing or for dumping beverages, not both. Because this station has an ice dispensing soda fountain and no ice is being scooped, it is not necessary to have a handwashing station set up. If the sink is only used for dumping, the soap and towels should be removed.

Nail brushes are being hung from the handsink faucets in the kitchen.

To prevent potential cross-contamination, the nail brushes should be stored in a manner that will protect them from splash contamination during handwashing and allow them to dry between uses, also the brushes should be cleaned and sanitized frequently throughout the day. If the brushes are not required by company policy, it is recommended to remove them all together.

Current Smithfield's policy, according to manager, is to date the potato salad with the date that it is assembled but the potatoes used for the potato salad are frequently cooked and cooled a day prior to when the potato salad is actually assembled. NC Food Code date marking requirements are to date marked potentially hazardous food items with the date that the oldest ingredient used in the food product was prepared or opened. The refrigeration in this facility holds food well below 40F so by NC Food Code requirements, foods may be held up to 7 days but the correct date must be used.

Consider removing the diverter from the mop sink and add a hose bib atmospheric vacuum breaker with a side kick.

In the 7 days until follow up visit, please record these final cook temperatures during initial cook so that they can be reviewed and discussed at follow up.***  Please be aware that storage of items in back fire exit hallway may be a violation of Fire Code in some jurisdictions.

Chicken broth was being cooled by placing a large bucket type container on the prep sink drainboard with an ice wand, it appeared to be reaching required cooling parameters but it is recommended to either cool the broth using the ice wand in an ice bath or in the freezer. The chicken was pulled off the bone and chopped after cooking, which brought the temperature down significantly and was then put into a pan about 6 inches deep and placed in the freezer, however, the thickness of the chicken in the container could impede the cooling process. Recommend spreading the chicken out on a sheet pan or separating it out into 2 containers to lessen the thickness of the food. 

Also discussed labeling on portioned chicken salad for sale as a ""grab and go"" item. Foods that are available for customer self-service must be properly labeled as follows: 1) common name of the food 2) list of the food ingredients, if more than 2 ingredients, in descending order 3) accurate declaration of the quantities 4) name and place of business where the food was made, packaged, and/or distributed 5) the name of the food source of each major allergen container in the food unless the source is already in the common name of the food; they were not being used during inspection, but the Red Bull and Pepsi coolers in the dining room are not approved for foods that are packaged in the restaurant.

Recommendation is being made to condense the menu.  Since baking and cooking of other foods are being performed in this establishment, storage is overlapping and becoming extremely difficult.  Even with multiple deliveries spread out through the week, it appears that the food establishment can not accommodate storage without an increase chance of cross contamination due to improper storage.  This is something worth pursuing in order to still provide a quality product and prevent the possibility of a customer becoming ill.  I would be more than willing to discuss this in further detail.
