This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When
you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the
code.  We begin with a basic initialization of the R environment.

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(readr)
library(magrittr)
library(lubridate)
```

Read in data. Using `readr::read_csv` seems better on these data
(`fread` has errors).

```{r}
inspection <- read_csv("raleigh/data/Food_Inspections.csv") %>%
  data.table()
violation <- read_csv("raleigh/data/Food_Inspection_Violations.csv") %>%
  data.table()
restaurant_info <- read_csv("raleigh/data/Restaurants_in_Wake_County.csv") %>%
  data.table()
```

We first remove first column which is OBJECTID, but it has some kind of byte order mark
so removing it by number.

```{r}
inspection <- subset(inspection, select = -1)
violation <- subset(violation, select = -1)
restaurant_info <- subset(restaurant_info, select = -1)
```

Examine how well the datasets would merge.
```{r}
inspection[ , uniqueN(HSISID)]
violation[ , uniqueN(HSISID)]
restaurant_info[ , uniqueN(HSISID)]
setdiff(inspection$HSISID, violation$HSISID)
setdiff(violation$HSISID, inspection$HSISID)
setdiff(inspection$HSISID, restaurant_info$HSISID) %>% length()  # > 1,000 mis-matches
setdiff(restaurant_info$HSISID, inspection$HSISID) %>% length()
```

Merge inspections and violations.
```{r}
dat <- merge(inspection, violation, by.x = c("HSISID", "Date"),
             by.y = c("HSISID", "InspectDate"), all.x = TRUE)  # left join
```

Examine further the mis-matches: those that are in inspection, not in restaurant_info.
```{r}
dat[!(HSISID %in% restaurant_info$HSISID), ]
```

We note that in `violation`, there are no ViolationCode's that are NA. So in
the merged dataset, if the ViolationCode is NA, it is because there was no
matching violation, so we set the value of the ViolationCode to "none", i.e.,
there was an inspection with no violation.
```{r}
violation[is.na(ViolationCode)]  # empty
violation[ , unique(ViolationCode)]  # show all codes
dat[is.na(ViolationCode) , ViolationCode := "none"]
```

Merge insections and violations with restaurant info.
```{r}
dat <- merge(dat, restaurant_info, by = "HSISID")
```
